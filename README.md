1. Description
The Extension should be used in the following situations: AI Admins who need to analyze applications which use BPEL script and WSDL service file. BPEL script is a language to specify BPEL processes. It provides a compact syntax inspired by scripting languages such as JavaScript and Ruby and a full coverage of all features provided by BPEL.

A BPEL process specifies in which order Web services should be invoked. It means A BPEL process receives a request and to full fill this invokes the involved Web services and then respond back to caller. Itâ€™s also possible a Web service can depend on the previous invokes also.

Implementation Patterns:-  

1. WSDL Process --> BPEL Process --> BPEL Invoke
2. WSDL Operation ->  WSDL Process ->BPEL Process ->BPEL Invoke -> Java Method

Objects created which are required only for transactions :
